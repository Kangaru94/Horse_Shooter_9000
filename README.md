# Horse_Shooter_9000
Completed the Unity tutorial of feeding horses and added additional features just to see if I could. It was difficult, but worth it for the experience. 

Additional features:

Scoring system

Display of score

End game message on screen

Player destroyed upon collision with horse, ending game
